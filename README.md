MODULE 22
With this module I used from our past lessons on SQL. Utilizing Spark, I created temporary views, partitioned the dataset, cached and uncached a temporary table, and verified the uncaching process.

I constructed a temporary table called home_sales and used SparkSQL to answer the following questions:

What is the average sale price of four-bedroom homes for each year? The results are rounded to two decimal places.
What is the average price of homes built in each year that feature three bedrooms and three bathrooms? The results are rounded to two decimal places.
What is the average price of homes built in each year that have three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a minimum size of 2,000 square feet? The results are rounded to two decimal places.
What is the average home price for each "view" rating where the average home price is at least $350,000? Additionally, I calculated the query runtime and rounded the results to two decimal places.
